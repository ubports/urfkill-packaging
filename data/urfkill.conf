[general]
## Type:    string
## Default: root
#
# By default, urfkilld is ran with root privilege in order
# to open the device nodes. In case you have a security concern,
# set this variable to a valid username in the system, and then
# urfkilld will drop root privilege and switch to the user after
# the devices nodes are opened.
#
user=root

## Type:    boolean (true/false)
## Default: true
#
# This variable is to enable/disable the key control function
# in urfkill. While it's enabled, urfkilld will listen to
# WLAN/BLUETOOTH/WIMAX/UWB keys and change the states of the
# killswitches.
#
# Note: For the machines with hardware controlled rfkill keys,
#       it's recommended to set this variable to false.
#
# key_control=true

## Type:    boolean (true/false)
## Default: false
#
# A master key is a key that controls all killswitches, and
# it's generally useful for the laptop with only one rfkill
# key.
#
# Note: Some platform drivers such as thinkpad-acpi control
#       the bluetooth killswitch by its own and only emit
#       WLAN key. In this case, the master key function will
#       conflict with the platform drivers, and it would be
#       better to set this variable to false.
#
# master_key=false

## Type:    boolean (true/false)
## Default: false
#
# When this variable is true, urfkilld will forcibly sync the
# states of the killswitches with the same type. Don't set this
# to true unless you encounter a sync problem.
#
# force_sync=false

## Type:    boolean (true/false)
## Default: true
#
# When this variable is true, persist (save to disk on shutdown
# and restart on startup) the state of killswitches across
# restarts.
#
# persist=true
