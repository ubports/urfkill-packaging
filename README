===========

urfkill is a project to handle rfkill events in userspace and
aimed to replace the rfkill input handler in kernel, i.e.
rfkill-input, and provide a flexible policy for rfkill keys.

Requirements:
   glib-2.0              >= 2.30.1
   gio-2.0               >= 2.30.1
   libudev               >= 148
   polkit-gobject-1      >= 0.91
   expat                 >= 2.0.1
   gobject-introspection >= 0.6.7 (optional)

Configuration:
   1. All urfkill-related configuration and hardware profile
      files will be installed in ${sysconfdir}/urfkill.
      (${sysconfdir} is usually /etc for the most of distros)
   2. The default configuration file of urfkill is urfkill.conf
      which allows the user to overwrite the default settings.
   3. hardware.conf will be created automatically by urfkilld
      according to the hardware profiles in profile/ during the
      first time startup.
   4. The hardware profiles are the rules to match the strings
      in the DMI table. You can check the DMI strings in
      /sys/class/dmi/id.
   5. If you found a hardware profile which perfectly fits your
      laptop, please feedback it to me so I can include it into
      the hardware profiles:-)
